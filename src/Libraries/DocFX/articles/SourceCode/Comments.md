# Comments

Attempts have been made to make the Abatab source code as human-readable as possible, so I'm keeping the comments to a minimum. The document you are currently reading is the primary source of information about how everything works.

That being said, you will find the following types of comments in the MAWSC sourcecode:

```#bash
/// XML comments used by Visual Studio
```

```#bash
// Additional code description comment
```

```#bash
/* Single-line narrative comment */
```

```#bash
/* Multiple-line  
 * narrative
 * comment  
 */
```
