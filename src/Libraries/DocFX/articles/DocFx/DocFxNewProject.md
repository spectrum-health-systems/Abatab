# Creating a new DocFX project

DocFX is integrated directly to Abatab via a class library.

You can use the included DocFX project, or create your own by following these steps:

1. Create a new .NET Framework 4.8 Class Library project named "DocFX"
2. Add the docfx.console NuGet package
3. Remove "DocFX/Class1.cs"
3. Add DocFX/ to Abatab/Libraries/"
4. Add the DocFX project to Abatab, in the Libraries/ solution folder
