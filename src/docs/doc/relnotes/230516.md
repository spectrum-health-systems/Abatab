## Progress Note TeleHealth location verification functionality

Initially the TeleHealth location verification functionality was specific to two forms:

* Individual Counseling Note (any Service Charge Code that started with "TMH" or "AOTMH")
* Group Individualized Note (only "TMH90853" and "AOTMH90853" Service Charge Codes)

Turns out, most Progress Notes need this functionality.

The switch statement in `Abatab.Module.ProgressNote.VerifyLocation()` has been changed from this:

```#csharp
switch (abSession.RequestAction)
{
    case "groupindinote":

        <CODE>

        break;
            
    case "indicounselingnote":

        <CODE>

        break;

    default:
        break;
}
```

To this:

```#csharp
switch (abSession.RequestAction)
{
    case "telehlth90853":

        <CODE>

        break;
            
    case "telehlthwildcards":

        <CODE>

        break;

    default:
        break;
}
```
