| Combine "Core.AbatabLogging.BuidlPath.cs" and Core.AbatabLogging.BuildPaths.cs | Maybe these two should be combined?

| Add Abatab version to log files                                                | Not sure if this should be every logfile, or what format it should take (maybe like the error code on popups?), but this would give us another datapoint in troubleshooting.                                                                                                                                           |            |
