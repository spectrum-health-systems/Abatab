# Abatab Roadmap Queue

## Web Server directories
There should be three directories on the web server:

1. AbatabWebService - the web service

* Abatab_LIVE
* Abatab_UAT
* Abatab_SBOX

2. AbatabData - data such as Lieutenant stuff, Abatab logs, etc.

3. AbatabPublic - data available to the public.

## Issue when an environment is refreshed

When an environment is refreshed, the WSDLs come down from LIVE, and need to be recreated in the refreshed environment.

Is there a better way to do this?

## New images

We have:

* Changelog
* Logo
* Manual Logo
* Release Notes
* Roadmap

We may need:

* Blank
* Flowchart
* Development notes
