# Abatab development

Abatab development takes place in X "Stages".

## **Stage I**: Monthly development branches and testing

The majority of Abatab development takes place in **monthly development branches**, where:

* New functionality is added, and existing functionality is updated/modified
* Bugs are squished
* Code is refactored
* New documentation is added, and existing documentation is updated/modified
* Continual testing is done in a non-production environment

On the first day of a new month, a new monthly development branch is created from the previous monthly development branch.





Abatab development takes place in the following repositories:

* `MM.DD-development`  
These are the monthly development



<br>














The current development version branch of Abatab is `v23.6`.

## Things to keep in mind about development version branches

Abatab development version branches:

* May be broken!
* May have missing functionality!
* Will have lots of ugly, gross code!
* Will have extensive comments!
* Might be dangerous to use!

<br>



<br>

## Development Version Branch

The majority of development is done in the **development version branch**, including additions and updates to documentation.

The development version branch name is the version being developed (e.g., `23.5d`). Please note the `d` postfix, which indicates that this branch is for development.

The version branch is not deployed to the web service host.



## Development branch

Once the version branch is stable, it is merged with the **Development Branch**.

This is the branch that is deployed to the web service host, and used for testing.

## Main branch

When testing functionality in the development branch is complete, it is merged with the **Main Branch**.

This is the official current development release of Abatab.

### Release types

When a version of Abatab is completed and released, the branch is renamed to `YY.MMx`, where `x` is:

* `d` for development branches that may not be fully functional
* `f` for final branches that have been tested and are fully functional
* stable
* rc
* cr
* hf
