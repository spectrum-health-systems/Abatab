# About Abatab

[Netsmart's myAvatar™](https://www.ntst.com/offerings/myavatar) is an electronic health record (EHR) specifically designed for organizations that provide behavioral health and addictions treatment services in community-based, residential and inpatient programs. It offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive decision-making. The robust platform streamlines workflow, making client information quickly accessible with user-friendly dashboards.

While myAvatar™ is a robust platform, it isn't perfect. The good news is that you can extend myAvatar™ functionality via Netsmart's myAvatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by other myAvatar™ users.

**Abatab** is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for myAvatar™ that aren't included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.
