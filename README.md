# About

[Netsmart's myAvatar™][MyAvatarUrl] is a behavioral health EHR that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive value-based care.

While myAvatar™ is a robust platform, it isn't perfect. The good news is that you can extend myAvatar™ functionality via Netsmart's myAvatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by other myAvatar™ users.

**Abatab** is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for myAvatar™ that aren't included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.

For more information, please see the [Abatab documentation][AbatabDocumentation].
