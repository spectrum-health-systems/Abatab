# About Abatab

[Netsmart's myAvatar™](https://www.ntst.com/offerings/myavatar) is an electronic health record (EHR) specifically designed for organizations that provide behavioral health and addictions treatment services in community-based, residential and inpatient programs. It offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive decision-making. The robust platform streamlines workflow, making client information quickly accessible with user-friendly dashboards.

While myAvatar™ is a robust platform, it isn't perfect. The good news is that you can extend myAvatar™ functionality via Netsmart's myAvatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by other myAvatar™ users.

**Abatab** is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for myAvatar™ that aren't included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.

## Features

* Custom tools and utilities for use with myAvatar™
* Does not require Java to be installed
* A solid foundation to build additional myAvatar™ custom tools and utilities

## Requirements

* A location where you can host Abatab which meets the following requirements:
  * .NET Framework 4.8+ installed
  * Access to your myAvatar™ environments via HTTPS
