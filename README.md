# About

[Netsmart's myAvatar™][MyAvatarUrl] is a behavioral health EHR that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive value-based care.

While myAvatar™ is a robust platform, it isn't perfect. The good news is that you can extend myAvatar™ functionality via Netsmart's myAvatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by other myAvatar™ users.

**Abatab** is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for myAvatar™ that aren't included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.

## Features

* Several built-in tools and utilities for use with myAvatar™
* Does not require Java to be installed
* A solid foundation to build additional myAvatar™ custom tools and utilities

## Requirements

* A location to host the Abatab which meets the following requirements:
* .NET Framework 4.8+ installed
* Access to yourmyAvatar™ environments via HTTPS

### Development requirements

* The [OptionObject2015][OptionObject2015]
