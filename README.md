# About

[Netsmart's myAvatar™](https://www.ntst.com/Solutions-and-Services/Offerings/myAvatar) is a behavioral health EHR that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive value-based care.

While myAvatar™ is a robust platform, like most things in life (except [Heroes of Might and Magic III](https://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition)), it isn't perfect.

The good news is that myAvatar™ functionality can be extended via Netsmart's myAvatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by myAvatar™ users.

**Abatab** is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for myAvatar™ that aren't included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.

## Features

* Several built-in tools and utilities for use with myAvatar™
* Does not require Java to be installed
* A solid foundation to build additional myAvatar™ custom tools and utilities

## Prerequisites

* A location to host the Abatab which meets the following requirements:
  * .NET Framework 4.8+ installed
  * Access to your myAvatar™ environments via HTTPS

# The Abatab manual

This readme is short and sweet because the [Abatab Manual](MANUAL), which is updated with each release, contains everything you need to know about Abatab.
